                <br/><br/>
                <p>It can't be a cliche because it actually can't be over-said: working on the Biden Campaign has been both the hardest and most rewarding experience of my career. It's a rare opportunity to work on something you care deeply about, with amazing people, and to succeed. I said it in 2016, and in 2018, and I'll say it again in 2020: the tech was never the point. I'm immensely proud of the work we did. The world will never fully understand the mountains that this scrappy team was able to move.</p>
                
                <p>To those who invited me in: thank you. To those who pushed me: thank you. To those who pushed with me: thank you.</p>

                <p>What's next? I'm going to sleep for a while. I don't know what's after that, but I won't be stepping away from the fight for democracy, justice, and a better world.</p>
